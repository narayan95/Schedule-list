#### Technologies Used
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment
- Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js
- EJS: A templating language for JavaScript

The application is structured as follows:

- The index.js file contains the main application logic.
- The views directory contains the HTML templates for the application.
- The public directory contains the static assets for the application, such as images and CSS files.

The application works as follows:

- When the application is started, it listens for requests on port 3000.
- When a user visits the application in a web browser, the index.ejs template is rendered.
- The index.ejs template contains a list of all of the tasks in the to-do list.
- Users can add new tasks to the to-do list by clicking on the "+" button.
- Users can mark their completed tasks by clicking on the checkbox which creates a line-through over that task.
- The application is a simple but effective way to keep track of tasks. It is easy to use and can be customized to meet the needs of the user.

The application also has a second route, localhost:3000/work, which displays a list of tasks that are specifically related to work.
Below is the screenshot of the second route screenshot.
